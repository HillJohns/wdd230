    <p>I have always appreciated Apple's use of whitespace on their website. It draws the
      users' attention to the most important thing on their website: the product. Their products
      have also always had very clean and minimal designs, so using these principles on their
      website compliments the products very well. In this example, they use literal white space 
      surrounding a 3D image of an Apple Watch and the focus is immediately drawn to it. 
      The rest of the website is easy to navigate and reflects their product design.
