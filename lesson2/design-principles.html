      <h3>Apple</h3>
      <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/">Apple Website</a>

    /> 
    <p>I have always appreciated Apple's use of whitespace on their website. It draws the
      users' attention to the most important thing on their website: the product. Their products
      have also always had very clean and minimal designs, so using these principles on their
      website compliments the products very well. In this example, they use literal white space 
      surrounding a 3D image of an Apple Watch and the focus is immediately drawn to it. 
      The rest of the website is easy to navigate and reflects their product design.

      <h3>Quip</h3>
      <a href="https://www.getquip.com/">Quip Website</a>
      <img
      src="./images/quip.jpg"
      alt="Screenshot of quip website"
    />
    <p>Quip's home website is a good example of visual heirarchy. The color of the heading 
      immediately drew my eyes to the brand name, and then contrast takes attention to their tagline.
      If someone didn't know what quip is, they would realize within the first few seconds of the page 
      loading that the brand name Quip sells toothbrushes that are geared toward making oral
      health simple. The different images that carousel through have different aspects of 
      visual heirarchy using differing levels of contrast and proximity.

    <p>
      Scrolling down through this website, there are a few different examples of grouping. The
      most obvious one however is through a regular sized PC browswer window. Each icon shown in 
      this screenshot is grouped together with a number and quick fact. The user is easily able to
      visual what the number portrays and move through the pattern to gain the information quickly.
      This one is also an excellent example of clean design, whitespace, and repetition.
