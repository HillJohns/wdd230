        <h3>Persona 2: Bob Sperry</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Age: 60</li>
          <li>Income: $89-99K</li>

        <p>Bob is a local businessman who has watched the city of Nephi expand by a great deal over
          the years. He wants to promote more growth both for the city, and his own small empire. He has decided 
          to sponsor local teams and high-school events in order to have his name become more recognized. Bob also
          wants to take part in helping other entrepenuers scale up their businesses to promote economical growth. 
          Bob knows how critical the internet is in the current business climate, so he is stepping out of his 
          comfort zone and onto an online platform. It is important to him that a website is straightforward
          and easy to navigate.
